#Receiving notifications

## Notifications
At various stages of the asynchronous customs declaration process your application will need to be notified by HMRC systems of certain events resulting from interactions with one of the CDS APIs. 

As a bare minimum for each declaration you can expect to receive a notification of acceptance and clearance, though others may be sent.

CDS DMSxxx notifications will be routed primarily to the submitter of the declaration. It is the responsibility of the submitter to then route the notifications to the declarant if appropriate.

All of the CDS APIs that use notifications offer the choice of either push or pull notifications. Part of an application’s [subscription](/documentation/set-up-developers.html#api-subscription-model) to a CDS API defines how notifications from that API will be delivered to it.

If the [subscription](/documentation/set-up-developers.html#api-subscription-model) specifies a push notification callback URL, that will indicate that the API should use push notifications. Notifications generated by this API will be sent to the supplied callback URL by CDS via this ‘channel’.

If the [subscription](/documentation/set-up-developers.html#api-subscription-model) omits the callback URL, that will indicate to the API that pull notifications are to be used. Your application will need to retrieve notifications from CDS via the [pull API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-notification-pull).

Each subscription of your application to an API can configure different notification mechanisms as required, so you can choose different notification mechanisms for different APIs.


##Push notifications

CDS ‘pushes’ notifications as they are generated via the specified channel to the trade systems. The trade systems need to always be ready to receive them (at the callback URL specified in the subscription).

If CDS successfully delivers a notification it cannot thereafter be resent. There are no API endpoints that would enable a re-delivery to be requested.

If CDS fails to deliver a notification (due to the specified callback URL not being contactable or the trade system responding with a non-200 HTTP response code) then it will reattempt to deliver the notification using the following rules:

<table>
  <tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Failure</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Retry Behaviour</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Callback URL does not respond or responds with a 5XX HTTP code</td>
    <td>
        CDS will retry to send the failed notification every 30 seconds until successful or until the notification expires (2 weeks from the original date of sending).
        <br><br>
        All other notifications due to be sent through the same subscription channel will be blocked until the issue is resolved. 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Callback URL responds with a 1XX, 3XX or 4XX HTTP code</td>
    <td>CDS will retry to send the notification back to the trade system every 2 hours until successful or until the notification expires (2 weeks from the original date of sending).
        <br><br>
        Other notifications to the same subscription channel will continue unaffected.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


##Pull notifications

Using this strategy the application ‘pulls’ notifications from CDS when it is ready to do so.

The Pull API endpoints allow identification and retrieval of selected notifications via a range of identifiers.

Pull retrieval also allows (within limits) previously read notifications to be re-read if necessary.

For more details about using the API please see the [Pull notifications API documentation](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-notification-pull) on the Dev Hub.
