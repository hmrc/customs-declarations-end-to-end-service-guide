#Query declaration status

The status of a successfully submitted declaration changes as it progresses through its lifecycle journey. 

A declarant can check on the current status of their submitted declarations by using one of the four query endpoints in the [Customs Declarations Information API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations-information).

The endpoints allow querying declarations by:

- MRN - will return the declaration that matches the MRN
- DUCR - Will return any/all declarations associated with this DUCR
- UCR - Will return any/all declarations associated with this UCR
- Inventory Reference - Will return any/all declarations associated with this IR

For details about the information returned by the query endpoints please refer to the [Customs Declarations Information API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations-information) documentation.
