# Customs Declaration Service end-to-end service guide

This guide explains how you can integrate your software with our APIs to complete a customs declaration.

It shows how the APIs fit into various end-to-end user journeys. It is also intended to help software developers, designers, product owners or business analysts understand how your software needs to interact with HMRC systems.

## Overview
The Customs Declaration Service (CDS) is replacing the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (CHIEF) with a modern and flexible system that can handle anticipated future import and export growth.

[More information about the Customs Declaration Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/customs-handling-of-import-and-export-freight-chief-replacement-programme).


For imports or exports outside outside of the European Union, there will be differences in the information they need to put in their declarations. This is due to changes to the [UK Trade Tariff](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-trade-tariff-volume-3-for-cds) required by the Union Customs Code.

## End-to-end user journeys
These journeys show examples of use.
