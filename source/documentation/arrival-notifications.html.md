#Making Arrival Notifications

A goods arrival message must be sent to inform CDS of the arrival of cargo at an ‘Office of Entry’ in the UK.

Where goods arrive at an inventory linked Office of Entry then it is a CSP that needs to make the arrival notification via the relevant endpoint in the [Customs Inventory Linking Imports API (CSPs only)](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-inventory-linking-imports)

Where goods arrive at a non-inventory linked import location then it is a trader that needs to make the arrival notification via the relevant endpoint in the [Customs Declarations API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customs-declarations).
