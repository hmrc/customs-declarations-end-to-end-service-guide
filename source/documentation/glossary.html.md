## EORI

## ICR
Inventory consignment reference. The CSP inventory system consignment is linked with CDS by ICRs, which will be cross-referenced against the declaration and used to identify the consignment and declaration in subsequent messages between CDS and the CSP inventory system.

The ICR is declared as the master unique consignment reference (MUCR).

        This status will be received once the declaration has a positive customs position but either control or the debt is provisional. 
        However, the goods can be released. This will be received as part of a Declaration Status Notification.

        This status will be received once the declaration has a positive customs position and the control/debt is finalised.
        The majority of declaration will move to this status and skip release. This will be received as part of a Declaration Status Notification.

## Inventory Reference 
This is only used for import declarations and is the same as a MUCR.


## LRN 
The Local Reference Number (LRN) defined by the declarant and submitted in Data Element 2/5 will need to be unique for a period of 2 days from the point of declaration acceptance. It can only be reused once the 2 calendar days have elapsed.


## MRN 
A Movement Reference Number (MRN) is a globally unique identifier for a declaration assigned by CDS once a declaration is submitted.


##Office of Entry

An ‘Office of Entry’ is a location into which goods arrive in the UK. There are 2 types:
- Inventory Linked - where CSPs make the ‘arrival of goods’ notification to customs
- Non-Inventory Linked - where traders must make the ‘arrival of goods’ notification to customs themselves

## Participants

- Declarant - the owning person/company responsible for make a declaration
- Submitter - an individual trader, authorised agent or CSP that electronically submits a declaration to CDS via the APIs 
- CSP - Community System Provider, they control the major Office of Entry for goods into the UK

## UCRs
Unique Consignment References are a unique identifier for ‘packages’ and/or ‘containers’ in which goods are transported. There are 2 types of UCRs which are:

- Declaration (DUCRs) - assigned by the declarant to uniquely identify a single consignment of goods which is the subject of one or more customs declarations 
- Master (MUCRs) - used to group or ‘link’ several other UCRs under a master UCR (MUCR)

You can think of a MUCR as ‘containing’ its child UCRs. A MUCR can contain both DUCRs and potentially other MUCRs (in a nested structure up to seven levels deep). The nested nature of MUCRs means that all MCUR will have 1..n child UCRs and 0..1 parent MUCR.
